##Lecture 1

Data engineering - in this class, it will be termed as big data software engineering.

It includes:

1. social networks

2. Data analysis – sampling – (data analysis using machine learning)

3. Storage – NoSQL – for evolving schema, fast delivery of the data, but not good in doing arbitrary queries. NoSQL has document, graph, key value, columnar stored based databases. 

Data modeling is hard, expensive, easy to get wrong for large level big data situation, even in migration. Difficult to do migration in big data with tereabytes of the big data information. 

Data collection and cleaning of the data – from where data is coming and if the data is in the acceptable format 
Data needs to be cleaned before storage or you can store the data and run batch jobs to clean data and restore it. 

Infobiz side effect – examples- D3 javascript , tablon, R etc. frameworks 

Data life cycle – Its a closed loop of the steps namely: 
	
1. question – curation – triage (prioritizing according to the situation) -  persistence
2. collection then generation
3. cleanup	
4. storage
5. processing or analysis
6. query and visualize or act

After step 6, it again goes back to the step 1 to get refined responses. Life cycle described above will be in all the data engineering process in every company. 

As a user, google search, filter, mobile app, web app are ways to interact to big data. 

An HTTP request uses the HTTP network protocol to further use get, put, post, delete requests which goes to HTTP server, which receives the HTTP request and responses back. This is known as request response cycle.
